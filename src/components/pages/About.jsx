               <p>
                    This is Vigneswari Sambandam aka Viggy. I am currently doing my masters in Information Technology. I'm an accomplished IT professional with 14 years of experience developing and architecting IT applications across industries with a proven track record of delivering value to Healthcare, Telecom, and Service Industries businesses. I wanted to upskill myself and embrace the changes and happenings in recent years in IT. So, I took a break and came to the US for a master's, and now I'm also doing the Berkeley Coding Bootcamp for additional skills. Apart from work and studies, I love watching movies, listening to music, and sometimes reading books. I empathize with people and hate all kinds of discrimination against people in all forms.
